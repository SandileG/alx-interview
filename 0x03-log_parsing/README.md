# 0x03. Log Parsing

## Project Overview

The **Log Parsing** project is designed to enhance your Python programming skills by focusing on the parsing and processing of data streams in real-time. This project will involve reading logs from standard input, handling them in a specified format, and performing calculations based on the input data to derive meaningful insights.

## Key Concepts

To successfully complete this project, you will need to familiarize yourself with several important concepts:

- **File I/O in Python**: Understanding how to read from standard input (stdin) line by line is crucial for handling log data effectively. 
  - [Python Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)

- **Signal Handling in Python**: You will learn how to manage keyboard interruptions (e.g., pressing CTRL + C) using signal handling to ensure your program can exit gracefully.
  - [Python Signal Handling](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html)

- **Data Processing**: This involves parsing strings to extract specific data points and aggregating the data to compute summaries, enabling efficient analysis of log entries.

- **Regular Expressions**: Familiarity with regular expressions is essential for validating the format of each log line, ensuring that your parser can handle variations and errors in the log format.
  - [Python Regular Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

- **Dictionaries in Python**: Utilizing dictionaries will allow you to count occurrences of various status codes and accumulate file sizes, making it easier to summarize the log data.
  - [Python Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

- **Exception Handling**: Properly handling exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing will ensure your program is robust and can handle unexpected input gracefully.
  - [Python Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)

## Requirements

This project is structured to be compatible with Python and focuses on real-time data parsing. All code should be well-documented, adhering to the PEP 8 style guide, and should include exception handling to manage potential errors.

## Getting Started

To begin working on the project:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Review the provided sample log entries to understand the format you will be parsing.
3. Implement the log parsing functionality, focusing on reading from stdin, extracting relevant information, and computing metrics.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how your log parsing script should work:

```bash
$ python3 log_parser.py < log_file.txt
```

This command will read from `log_file.txt`, process the log entries, and output the computed metrics.

## Additional Resources

For further insights and guidance, consider exploring the following resources:

- [Python File I/O Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)
- [Signal Module Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html)
- [Regular Expressions in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
- [Python Dictionaries Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)
- [Exception Handling in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)

By studying these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be well-prepared to tackle the Log Parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.
