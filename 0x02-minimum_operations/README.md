# Minimum Operations Project

## Project Overview

The **Minimum Operations** project is centered around finding the most efficient way to reach a target number of characters using only two operations:

1. **Copy All** - Copies the entire current set of characters.
2. **Paste** - Pastes the copied characters to add to the existing set.

The challenge is to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to achieve exactly `n` characters, starting from one character. This project combines algorithmic problem-solving with mathematical reasoning to devise an optimal approach.

## Key Concepts

The project requires an understanding of several fundamental computer science and mathematical concepts:

- **Dynamic Programming**: By breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems, we can build up an efficient solution incrementally.
- **Prime Factorization**: This mathematical approach helps reduce the problem by examining the prime factors of the target number, which leads to a sequence of operations.
- **Code Optimization**: Writing efficient code minimizes computation and improves performance, especially as `n` grows larger.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: This strategy involves choosing the most immediate, beneficial step at each point, which can yield an optimal solution in fewer steps.

## Requirements

This project is built using Python and is structured to be compatible with Ubuntu 20.04. All code is documented and follows the PEP 8 style guide. Additionally, this README provides an overview of the project goals and instructions for usage and testing.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Ensure that each file is executable, and begin by examining the code documentation for detailed information on each function and module. The project is structured to be straightforward, with a primary function for calculating minimum operations and helper functions for number manipulation and optimization.

## Running the Project

To execute the solution:

1. Run the primary script with `python3 <filename.py>` to test the minimum operations function.
2. Check the output to see the minimum number of operations for a given target number `n`.

You can modify the target number in the script to experiment with different values.

## Example Usage

```python
# Example of expected output for n = 9
Target Number (n): 9
Minimum Operations: 6
```
